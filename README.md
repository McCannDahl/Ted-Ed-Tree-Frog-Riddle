This riddle on youtube presents a puzzling probability.

The goal of this script is to prove or debunk the statistics in this video using simulation.

# Results
The simulation confirms Ted-ed was correct. Turning around and licking two frogs will yeild a survival chance of 67%.

# Simpler example
To me a simpler example would be to think about a coin. If I flip a coin twice and I know one of the times will be heads, what are the odds I flip a tails? Well, since I know one flip will be heads, we know they can't both be tails. That leaves 3 scenarios. The first scenario is that both are heads. The 2nd and 3rd scenario each have a flip that is tails. This means 2 or the 3 scenarios will have a tails giving us the 67%.
